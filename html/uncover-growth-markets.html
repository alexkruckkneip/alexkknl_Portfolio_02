						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							During the 8 years working for TimoCom I started in the Marketing Department and helped in the core group to create a completely new brand design.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							From 2010 I was invited to start as first product designer in the development department.
							In four years I’ve founded TimoComs first product design team of four and together we aligned the 2 existing apps with the new brand design.
							Later, in partnership with the leadership team, we created and launched the new two products TC eMap and TC eBid.
						</p>
						<h2 class="text-color-primary-200 text-style-h2">Business objective 2014</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							But at the end of 2013 we realised that we couldn't keep up with the competition from Poland in our current form.
							In addition, there was no longer any growth in many markets in which TimoCom was active.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							That's why Jens Thiermann, owner of TimoCom, Europe's largest digital freight exchange, took a bold step at the beginning of 2014.
							He founded the subsidiary Ticonex with the aim of discovering new growth markets and introduce new competitive web technologies.
							At the core of this endeavor was an entirely new innovation team.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						From a business perspective there was a huge issue that we had only Germany as a very strong market.
						Sales in the country of our headquarters exceeded almost all other sales from other countries in Europe in which TimoCom offers its services.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The sales team was in regular communication with all customers in each of our markets in Europe.
						The question was regularly asked in surveys as to why customers are so inactive on our platform.
						The most frequently cited reason was that there were simply too few offers.
					</p>

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2">Data research</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Some ad hoc experiments with our application showed that there is at least low supply in weak markets.
							However, these could only be found with difficulty or not at all using the search of our main product TC Truck&amp;Cargo.
						</p>
					</div>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The way the search for freight or a truck worked was that a square area around the start and destination points was scanned for offers.
							No offers could be found that might have existed along a route.
							Therefore, there was currently no effective way for our customers to recognise and use the available offer potential.
						</p>

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2">Growth chain reaction</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The idea was that if we could make this potential visible to our customers, this would in turn invite them to enter further offers on our logistics platform.
							This could trigger a growth chain reaction that turns weak markets into strong pillars for our business.

						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2">No regular research on&nbsp;data</h2>

						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2">Different tech platforms</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Many products were built on different software platforms and didn't consider up to date web technology.
							It took a lot of effort and exceptions for us in the product design team to make all products similar, at least in terms of UI and Brand Design.
						</p>
					</div>

							Since we built this web app for B2B customers, there was no way around getting in touch directly with them.
							Luckily I was able to convince members of the sales team to organise regular user testing.
							Together we built a loop of regular user surveys with real customers to get first hand qualitative data.

						</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							This is where the new method was used to simply omit the process of hi-fi prototyping.
							Using rough mockups on the whiteboard or tablet PC, I coordinated directly with the product manager and the front and backend developers what we wanted to create.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							In a new branch of our repository, I quickly received a rough structure from the front-end developer in which I could directly implement the UI and UX design of the prototype.
							At the same time, front and backend developers worked on connecting the real data for testing in the background.
							Together we were able, among other things, to prepare a new version of the application for the next user test.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="grid-item">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2">
							<span class="text-color-primary-200 text-style-h1">5.</span> Test
						</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							As mentioned above, I convinced two sales colleagues to conduct user testing.
							In coaching sessions, I introduced the two of them to the basics of user survey methodology, which I had learned as a usability engineer at the Fraunhofer Institute in Bonn.
							For the user testing itself, I provided them with a new moderation guide in Microsoft Word.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The colleagues from the sales team tried to invite at least 5 customers to the user test every two weeks, which they succeeded quite well.
							Together we finalised the moderation guide and I added the link to the prototype currently being tested.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							In order to test the new prototypes with users, we converted a small room into a makeshift test laboratory.
							We provided hardware that we learned was roughly the same as that used by our personas.
							The interviewer was present during the test and we were able to add additional observers via a webcam.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The user interviewers preferred to print out the moderation guide and take notes.
							Since they had other tasks as members of the sales team, they put together a short summary of their observations and key findings in a Word document for us.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="grid-item">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2">Iterate</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Of course, the Design Sprint process was not linear.
							Loops often occurred in all steps or it was necessary to return to previous stages of the process.
							But overall, in a good 90% of cases we were able to stick to our two-week rhythm for a Design Sprint.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Sure, a Design Sprint can in theory be completed in a week.
							In practice, with this extensive project with the resources we had, we couldn't do it in a shorter time.

						<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Fleet manager</h3>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Goods logistician</h3>

							The last important group were goods logisticians who worked for companies that did not maintain their own truck fleet.
							Similar to the fleet managers, this group also often had to deliver goods on a regular basis.

						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The main task of our users was observing the market for either offers of freight or empty space in trucks.
							Every row, representing an offer in the result table of our platform, was necessary and could hold the next important deal.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The update button above the offer table was sometimes pressed several times during a second to update it, as new offers were not automatically displayed.

						<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Fear of being scammed</h3>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The next major stressor was the fear of losing money to a fraudulent company.
							Each fleet manager had developed their own indicators for identifying a company with fraudulent intentions.
							The telephone played a crucial role here.
							With our product TC Profile, the phone numbers of the providers could be found very quickly.
							For this reason, the companies were always called personally before the deal was concluded.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Two separate TimoCom products were used for these tasks alone, TC Truck&amp;Cargo and TC Profile.

					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Fear of goods being stolen</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Another product was mentioned which was used to provide security.
						The web application TC eMap, which was previously completed under my design leadership, was able to track goods and vehicles.
						This created greater security that goods did not simply disappear and that the truck reached its destination safely and on time.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Our main business goal was to make small offers visible along a route.
						The best solution for us after several iterations was to better visualise the search results using a map.

					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Sandbox for Designers</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The particularly close connection between design and development in our cross-functional team has made it possible to create the best solution of the map.
						I was able to experiment with different designs in a sandbox and test them with real users using real live backend data.

						<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Design System in code</h3>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							It's incredible how everything becomes easier when you don't use an application like Figma to develop the design system.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						I simply created an overview page with all the elements used, colors, fonts, icons and components.
						This meant that even before Figma, different versions were possible that I shared with everyone in the team via branches and a common repository.
					</p>

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2">Filling whitespace</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							In the last 4 years as product designers at TimoCom, we have created a very compressed filter layout over hundreds of iterations.
							Restrictions that were given to us by the developers have resulted in wide strips of whitespace appearing next to the offer list on now normal monitors with HD resolution.
						</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Space for the 'Recurring Favorite Routes' filter.</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						As mentioned in the previous article, the fleet managers and goods logisticians personas have in common that they have to process recurring orders.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The new process of programming the hi-fi prototype directly after sketching the lo-fi version on a Samsung tablet accelerated my learning curve significantly.
						I learned how to create a modern, responsive web application in Sass, CSS, HTML and Angular JS.
						This allowed me to simply place the filter from the spot at the top of the results table to the left onto the empty white space.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						This also meant that the UX journey was better received because it could now start on the left, like reading, and then continue on the right.

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2 column-first-headline">Main business objective</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						As a team, we managed to create a new search that was able to easily find the small offers along a route.
						The main goal was thus achieved to increase the attractiveness of weak markets and thus to arouse new customer interest in becoming active on our platform.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Everything was ready to trigger the chain reaction of growth.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2">Never miss a new&nbsp;offer&nbsp;again</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Due to the newly deployed web technology, new offers triggered the system as soon as they were received and were immediately visible to users in real time.
						Because we moved the search filter from the top to the left, there was more space to show when new offers on the goods side became visible parallel to the freight search.
						This was of course particularly interesting for the group of free logistic managers.
					</p>

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2">More security through better UX and IA</h2>
						<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Offer details in the table</h3>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Previously, the results list was hidden when users clicked on an offer to see more details.
							With our solution, the details could be displayed directly in the results list.
							This prevented users from missing out on new offers.
						</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Company details on&nbsp;the&nbsp;right</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The result list of our design solution was fed primarily via API from the backend data of our freight exchange TC Truck&Cargo.
						The data from the TC Profile application was also available to us in the same way.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						So we didn't have to open a new window to view the detailed company information.
						We still had space on the right side and our users could access the information there without having to take their eyes off the results list.
						In addition, it fit very well with the information architecture, as in most cases the user journey had its last step here.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						With the new solution, all information could be collected and processed by our customers more easily, effectively and quickly
					</p>
					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Integrated tracking</h3>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							And since we now had a map in the center and the data from TC eMap, we could also integrate tracking into the user journey.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h2 class="text-color-primary-200 text-style-h2">Inspire for more</h2>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">New persona self-driver</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						With the help of the new responsive web application design, we were able to make this complex application usable on a tablet PC.
						In addition to our three main personas, it was suddenly possible to target another group, the self-drivers.
						There were many truck drivers who organised one or more tours themselves.
						They now also had access to our offers in their vehicle to avoid driving empty.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3">Side projects growth&nbsp;hacking</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Many of the new technologies we used inspired us to create projects that we implemented in side Design Sprints.
						We have developed an app that optimizes grocery shopping for our canteen and increases the positive experience for our colleagues.
						Or the web app “GoPolly” to enable live polls during presentations.
						But I will present these case studies on a separate website.
