					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Bots have been the biggest innovation to reduce costs for Genesys customers in the call center service industry.
						The problem was that in 2019, bot authoring software could only be operated by highly trained engineers.
						After I started in March 2019, Genesys wanted to sell a fully-featured bot authoring software by the end of the year.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Senior stakeholders did not really believe in the success of the endevour to create a bot authoring app in this time frame.
						Our competitors, such as AWS and IBM, had already successfully launched similar applications in the market for quite some time.
						And when I came on board, I quickly realised that there wasn't even a consensus about the basic user journey and the UI.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						In this case study I tell the story of how a group of courageous product people and I persevered and convinced the US sales team with great ideas.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The UI design shown here was the result of a series of meetings and workshops with representatives from a wide range of disciplines.
						The language, data, AI and information scientists were spread across three different continents.
						Our first focus was on defining all the	tasks that need to be completed so that a conversation bot can be created by our customers.
						This version was therefore particularly suitable for specialists who already had the experience building chat bots.

						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Everyone involved probably already had solutions from competitors in mind.
							Because the focus was on user flow and UX, we used a standard UI kit for these initial UI designs.
							In this combination, what we had created up to this point also looked like established products on the market.
							Our Genesys unique selling point was missing.

						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Members of the senior sales team in the USA told me in interviews that getting started was the biggest problem for customers.
							As a rule, the salespeople had to acquire all the skills themselves in order to then set up the chat bots for Genesys's customers using alternatives from AWS or IBM.
							This usually got really expensive very quickly.
							The prospect of needing an expensive expert to set it up in the future also put off many customers.

						A core team worked on the project and was supplemented by other external specialist teams. The smaller core group was responsible for the strategy and consisted of a developer with a focus on artificial intelligence, two product managers, another developer for the front-end and me.
						This team alone was spread across The Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Romania.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Simple meeting minutes would never have been able to consistently and securely communicate complex content to the highly fragmented global team.
						So that participants who were unable to attend a meeting were not forced to watch the entire video recording, I took live notes and sketches on the screen during the sessions.
						I was then able to publish these as clues with a screenshot as a basis for the summary in Confluence.
						This meant everyone was able to access the information they needed efficiently and transparently.
						All of this helped to enable the functionality of the bot app in the first step.
					</p>
					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">First hybrid sketching session</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						We agreed in mid-April to make the topic of 'onboarding' a priority.
						I had already conducted sketching workshops with the team at Rentalcars several times.
						They really open the minds of a team and generate lots of awesome ideas.
						This&nbsp;type of workshop was completely new to the cross-functional Genesys team that I invited.
						For me, however, it was completely new to organise this meeting with a group that was both in the Galway office and remotely in Belfast.
						A little more effort had to be made to ensure that colleagues could participate remotely equipped with the appropriate tools.

						Similar to my meeting minutes on steroids I organised and documented the workshop using the software Confluence from Atlasian.
						The session begins under the heading 'Empathize' and here a product manager with a PHD in AI talked about her experiences.
						I gave a summary of the interviews I conducted with sales on the topic, presented the persona idea and insights I got from a competitor analysis.
						We then started to 'Ideate' using a modified version of the popular sketching method ‘Crazy Eights’.
						Participants had 10 minutes to outline around five suggestions for how we can onboard users like our persona Kevin into our bot authoring software.

						Because of the hybrid situation, I have decided that all participants will have until 12pm the next day to cast their vote.
						The winner of the session with 7 stars was the idea of the AI developer 'Guided conversation setup'.
						This idea was the basis for the next two steps in the design thinking process, prototype and test.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						We agreed in the core team to try harder to convince the sales team that we could develop a bot author application that also appeals to people like our persona Kevin.
						Unfortunately, when we started designing the prototype, we didn't have a UI kit available that would reflect the Genesys brand.
						Without it, we would not be able to clearly differentiate ourselves from our competitors.

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase column-first-headline">De:Bot</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Based on the best idea from our sketching workshop, we wanted to present our users with a character who would be fun to have a conversation with.
						Starting from the design elements of the Genesys logo brand, I finally designed the face for our bot authoring software Dialog Engine, De:Bot.
						In many extra shifts, I created a complete icon set and components that fit the design language used.

						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							In our previous concepts, we have not yet managed to create something for Kevin that would allow him to simply click together a bot from simple components.
							<!-- I was playing around with simple squares as symbols and that gave me the idea of the bot library. -->
							As I was playing around with basic shapes to find a solution, the idea of the bot component library came about.

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">The Library</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The special idea was that a new dimension was suddenly possible for our application.
							In addition to the possibility of structuring elements of the bot authoring software simply and clearly, the option of a marketplace for bot components was also on the table.
							With this idea, Genesys or third parties could create paid modules that users could purchase to make it easier to complete his task in the Ghostbusters chat.

						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Conversational onboarding</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Yes, the ideas just flew back and forth between the team members.
							But back to our first idea of creating a bot that could also safely and easily get non-developers on board.
							Together with product management, we designed a bot-led conversation that allowed all important elements of the application to be presented.
							Of course we used the Ghostbusters story as a theme and as a special treat, De:Bot turned into a ghost during the conversation.

						In early July, we finally tested the prototype with seven internal users and members of the senior US sales team.
						In summary, points 'Good overall design and Information Architecture' and 'Good story behind the onboarding' stand out particularly positively.
						The entire onboarding process was a bit too long.
						There were suggestions here that you could ask the bot for a break in the conversation.

							We got the green light and the full support of all senior management.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Now that we were at the point that sales would support us to test with real users we didn't know how to proceed immediately.
							No design team has ever been at this point before at Genesys.
							My answer was organising a couple of ideation sessions with senior stakeholders with the goal to get lined up ten B2B users for testing within the next two months.

						The product team regularly sent a presentation with an overload of information to customers to get in touch.
						The response rate was quite low. But I was able to get everyone on board with the idea of a little product promotion video.
						The copy and animation for the promotion video was ready, but we were missing sound.
						To convince our PM I did the first voiceover. My German accent was probably not so well received and the product manager showed how it can be done so much better.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Within two weeks we were able to double our expectations and lined up more than twenty customers who wanted to support us doing regular user testing on Dialog Engine.
