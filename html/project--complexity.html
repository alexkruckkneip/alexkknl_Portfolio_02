						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							During the 8 years working for TimoCom I started in the Marketing Department and helped in the core group to create a completely new brand design.

					</div>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						From 2010 I was invited to start as first product designer in the development department.
						In four years Iâve founded TimoComs first product design team of four and together we aligned the 2 existing apps with the new brand design.
						Later, in partnership with the leadership team, we created and launched the new two products TC eMap and TC eBid.

							But at the end of 2013 we realised that we couldn't keep up with the competition from Poland in our current form.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						That's why Jens Thiermann, owner of TimoCom, Europe's largest digital freight exchange, took a bold step at the beginning of 2014.
						He founded the subsidiary Ticonex with the aim of discovering new growth markets.
						At the core of this endeavor was an entirely new innovation team.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-300">
						[The screenshot shown above shows a real search on the main product TC Truck&amp;Cargo.
						As lead designer, I was completely responsible for UI and UX design until the end of 2013.
						When you read this on a device in landscape format it's easy to spot a lot of whitespace on the left and right of the table.
						The reason for this was simply that we had no one on the development team who could implement modern responsive web application design.]
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Customer Feedback</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						From a business perspective there was a huge issue that we had only Germany as a very strong market.
						Sales in the country of our headquarters exceeded almost all other sales from other countries in Europe in which TimoCom offers its services.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The sales team was in regular communication with all customers in each of our markets in Europe.
						The question was regularly asked in surveys as to why customers are so inactive on our platform.
						The most frequently cited reason was that there were simply too few offers.
					</p>

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Data research</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Some ad hoc experiments with our application showed that there is at least low supply in weak markets.
							However, these could only be found with difficulty or not at all using the search of our main product TC Truck&amp;Cargo.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The search was always only in a square around the start and finish points, but not in between.
						Therefore, there was currently no effective way for our customers to recognise and use the available offer potential.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Growth chain reaction</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The idea was that if we could make this potential visible to our customers, this would in turn invite them to enter further offers on our logistics platform.
						This could trigger a growth chain reaction that turns weak markets into strong pillars for our business.

					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">No UX discovery</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Although I had set up a pretty good product design team in the last 4 years, I hadn't had the opportunity to introduce modern UX design processes.
						The quickest and most obvious solution was always desired and that was then implemented.
					</p>

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">No regular research on&nbsp;data</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The experiments with data described in the previous article were a good start at the time.
							However, they did not yet follow a professional framework that could ensure quality and unbiased results.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Different tech platforms</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Many products were built on different software platforms and didn't consider up to date web technology.
							It took a lot of effort and exceptions for us in the product design team to make all products similar, at least in terms of UI and brand.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Multiple products for&nbsp;one user journey</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Even if customers were paying a flat rate for the whole package, the platform was split into four main products.
							The UX on each product was quite different, but the main user group needed minimum two of those to do their daily job.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">No responsive UI&nbsp;Design</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Within the structure of the development department, it was not possible for us to introduce new modern UI and UX designs methods.
							For example, our icon were still delivered in PNG or GIF format with a resolution of 16x16 pixels.
							Although we in the design team came up with ideas to change this, it was difficult to find allies.
						</p>
					</div>

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						There is a lot to be said for developing a product whose UX and UI were completely independent of the current product portfolio.

						Bi-weekly Design Sprints
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Innovation team for&nbsp;Aurora</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Under the new project name Aurora at Ticonex, we were able to start completely from scratch.
						All that was missing was someone who can kick off a new design area in the new cross functional team.
						With my certification as Usability Engineer in 2012 I saw the opportunity to use these new UX methods to support Ticonex to innovate successfully.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Connect via API</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						As described, the various products were too different to be able to benefit from synergy effects.
						That's why we decided to set up a completely new tech stack with the latest web technologies.
						The backend with the data of the live application should be connected via API.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-primary-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">The more</h2>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h3-uppercase">Code the prototype to&nbsp;be&nbsp;faster</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						I remember Fritz, the front and developer, just coming to me with this idea out of nowhere.
						Sounded super logical, but how was I supposed to work directly on the application in Node and Angular JS?
						The way we worked and fit together was like magic.
						We actually managed to test with a real prototype and real data in every design sprint.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h3-uppercase">Quantitative Feedback</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Following design thinking principles we wanted to be able to test and measure the success of an experiment for every design sprint.
						To get quantitative data we always planned where we could add a tracker into the code and defined what a success would look like.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h3-uppercase">Qualitative feedback from B2B customers</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						What we did not have in the cross functional team, was a user researcher.
						Since we built this web app for B2B customers, there was no way around getting in touch directly with them.
						Luckily I was able to convince members of the sales team to organise regular user testing.
						Together we built a loop of regular user surveys with real customers to get first hand qualitative data.

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase column-first-headline">Stats TimoCom platform</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Today, the platform has customers from <span class="text-color-grey-blue-50 text-style-p-bold">44 European countries</span> and supports <span class="text-color-grey-blue-50 text-style-p-bold">25 languages</span>.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Back in 2014, TimoCom offered the four products TC Truck&Cargo, TC Profile, TC eMap and TC eBid. The fifth product planned was TC Warehouse.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Personas &amp; Missons</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
					 We had identified about three large customer groups that were represented in roughly equal numbers.
				  </p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The <span class="text-color-grey-blue-50 text-style-p-bold">free logistic managers</span> did not have their own trucks or goods to transport.
						They used our freight exchange application as a trading platform to either find free spaces or ensure a truck was fully loaded.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The next large group were <span class="text-color-grey-blue-50 text-style-p-bold">fleet managers</span> in logistics companies with their own truck fleet.
						Here, trucks were often on recurring trips and often had the problem that the return trips were empty.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The last important group were <span class="text-color-grey-blue-50 text-style-p-bold">goods logisticians</span> who worked for companies that did not maintain their own truck fleet.
						Similar to the fleet managers, this group also often had to deliver goods on a regular basis.
						That's why their focus was on finding cheap empty space in a vehicle.
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Preferred work environment</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						In more than 80% of those surveyed, the users work was carried out at a standard desk.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The most important tools were a telephone and a PC with a larger than usual monitor.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Key findings</h2>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Fear&nbsp;of missing out on&nbsp;an&nbsp;offer</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The main task of our users was observing the market for either offers of freight or empty space in trucks.
						Every row, representing an offer in the result table of our platform, was necessary and could hold the next important deal.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The update button above the offer table was sometimes pressed several times during a second to update it, as new offers were not automatically displayed.
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Fear of being scammed</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The next major stressor was the fear of losing money to a fraudulent company.
						Each fleet manager had developed their own indicators for identifying a company with fraudulent intentions.
						The telephone played a crucial role here.
						With our product TC Profile, the phone numbers of the providers could be found very quickly.
						For this reason, the companies were always called personally before the deal was concluded.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Two separate TimoCom products were used for these tasks alone, TC Truck&amp;Cargo and TC Profile.
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Fear of goods being stolen</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Another product was mentioned which was used to provide security.
						The web application TC eMap, which was previously completed under my design leadership, was able to track goods and vehicles.
						This created greater security that goods did not simply disappear and that the truck reached its destination safely and on time.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Our main business goal was to make small offers visible along a route.
						The best solution for us after several iterations was to better visualise the search results using a map.
					</p>
					<h2 class="text-color-primary-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">The more</h2>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Sandbox for Designers</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The particularly close connection between design and development in our cross-functional team has made it possible to create the best solution of the map.
						I was able to experiment with different designs in a sandbox and test them with real users using real live backend data.
					</p>
					<div class="avoid-page-break">
						<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Design System in code</h3>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							It's incredible how everything becomes easier when you don't use an application like Figma to develop the design system.
						</p>
					</div>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						I simply created an overview page with all the elements used, colors, fonts, icons and components.
						This meant that even before Figma, different versions were possible that I shared with everyone in the team via branches and a common repository.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase column-first-headline">Using whitespace</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						In the last 4 years as product designers at TimoCom, we have created a very compressed filter layout over hundreds of iterations.
						The restrictions described have made it impossible to integrate a usable solution into the existing user interface.
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Space for the 'Recurring Favorite Routes' filter.</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						As mentioned in the previous article, the fleet managers and goods logisticians personas have in common that they have to process recurring orders.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The new process of programming the hi-fi prototype directly after sketching the lo-fi version on a Samsung tablet accelerated my learning curve significantly.
						I learned how to create a modern, responsive web application in Sass, CSS, HTML and Angular JS.
						This allowed me to simply place the filter from the spot at the top of the results table to the left onto the empty white space.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						This also meant that the UX journey was better received because it could now start on the left, like reading, and then continue on the right.

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase column-first-headline">Main business objective</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						As a team, we managed to create a new search that was able to easily find the small offers along a route.
						The main goal was thus achieved to increase the attractiveness of weak markets and thus to arouse new customer interest in becoming active on our platform.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Everything was ready to trigger the chain reaction of growth in the weak markets.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Never miss a new offer again</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Due to the newly deployed web technology, new offers triggered the system as soon as they were received and were immediately visible to users in real time.
						Because we moved the search filter from the top to the left, there was more space to show when new offers on the goods side became visible parallel to the freight search.
						This was of course particularly interesting for the group of free logistic managers.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">More security through better UX and IA</h2>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Offer details in the table</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Previously, the results list was hidden when users clicked on an offer to see more details.
						With our solution, the details could be displayed directly in the results list.
						This prevented users from missing out on new offers.
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Company details on the right</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The result list of our design solution was fed primarily via API from the backend data of our freight exchange TC Truck&Cargo.
						The data from the TC Profile application was also available to us in the same way.
						So we didn't have to open a new window to view the detailed company information.
						We still had space on the right side and our users could access the information there without having to take their eyes off the results list.
						In addition, it fit very well with the information architecture, as in most cases the user journey had its last step here.
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-color-grey-blue-300 text-style-h3-uppercase">Integrated tracking</h3>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						And since we now had a map in the center and the data from TC eMap, we could also integrate tracking into the user journey.
