					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						During the 8 years working for TimoCom I started in the Marketing Department and helped in the core group to create a completely new brand design.
						From 2010 I was invited to start as first product designer in the development department.
						In four years Iâve founded the first product design team of four and together we aligned the 2 existing apps with the new brand design.
						Later, in partnership with the leader-ship team, we created and launched the new two products TC eMap and TC eBid.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						But at the end of 2013 we realised that we couldn't keep up with the competition from Poland in our current form.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						In this case study I tell the story of how Jens Thiermann, owner of TimoCom, the largest digital freight exchange in Europe, took a courageous step and unleashed forces that we would never have thought possible.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Even if customers were paying a flat rate for the whole package, the platform was split into five main products.
						The UX on each product was quite different, but the main user group needed minimum two of those to do their daily job.
						Many products were built on different software platforms and didn't consider up to date web technology.

						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							In the four years before we started with the new innovation team, I was able to build a good team of product designers.
							Within the structure of the development department, it was not possible for us to introduce new modern UI and UX designs methods.
							For example, our icon were still delivered in PNG or GIF format with a resolution of 16x16 pixels.
							Although we in the design team came up with ideas to change this, it was difficult to find allies.

						<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Limited filter options</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							A common complaint was the limited way of finding offers with the filter of our software.
							It was only possible to find something in a specified square around the start and end points of a route.
							But with an empty truck, it would often make sense to find freight in the middle of, or along a route to not drive completely empty.

						The majority of TimoCom's business customers were fleet managers in forwarding companies, who had the task of safely and efficiently managing freight and trucks through Europe.

							Luckily, TimoCom was a subsidiary of the logistics company Timotrans.
							Here I had the opportunity to observe our target group in their daily work in a field research study.
							The main task of our users was observing the market for either offers of freight or empty space in trucks.
							Every row, representing an offer in the result table of our platform, was necessary and could hold the next important deal.
							Therefore, big monitors were a must.
						</p>

						The update button above the offer table was sometimes pressed several times during a second to update it, as new offers were not automatically displayed.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">

						Each fleet manager had developed their own indicators for identifying a company with fraudulent intentions.

						To finally give space for an innovative approach, TimoCom founded the new sub company Ticonex and a new innovation team within.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Under the new project name Aurora at Ticonex, we were able to start from scratch.
						Our task was to find solutions for the pain points and challenges described under the previous topic 'Problems'.
						We were allowed to decide ourselves which methods we wanted to use and which web technologies would offer the best solutions for our users' problems.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						It felt like everything was turned upside down.
						Instead of the in-house chat software, we introduced Slack for example.
						Java had to make way for Angular, NodeJS and more modern web technologies.
						Prototypes were no longer created in Photoshop to handover to our developers.
						I learned to create user flows and designs on a Samsung Note tablet and how to implement these ideas directly into code.

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Introducing measurement of&nbsp;success</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Following design thinking principles we wanted to be able to test and measure the success of an experiment for every design sprint.
						To get quantitative data we always planned where we could add a tracker into the code and defined what a success would look like.
						In the beginning we offered our customers a beta version with dummy data.
						But to really get customers in front of the screen to test our software, we quickly connected real data via API.

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">Qualitative feedback from B2B customers</h2>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						What we did not have in the cross functional team, was a user researcher.
						Since we built this web app for B2B customers, there was no way around getting in touch directly with them.
						Luckily I was able to convince members of the sales team to organise regular user testing.
						Together we built a loop of regular user surveys with real customers to get first hand qualitative data.

						Based on the best idea from our sketching workshop, we wanted to present our users with a character who would be fun to have a conversation with.
						Starting from the design elements of the Genesys logo brand, I finally designed the face for our bot authoring software Dialog Engine, De:Bot.
						In many extra shifts, I created a complete icon set and components that fit the design language used.

						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							In our previous concepts, we have not yet managed to create something for Kevin that would allow him to simply click together a bot from simple components.
							<!-- I was playing around with simple squares as symbols and that gave me the idea of the bot library. -->
							As I was playing around with basic shapes to find a solution, the idea of the bot component library came about.

					<h2 class="text-color-grey-blue-200 text-style-h2-uppercase">The Library</h2>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							The special idea was that a new dimension was suddenly possible for our application.
							In addition to the possibility of structuring elements of the bot authoring software simply and clearly, the option of a marketplace for bot components was also on the table.
							With this idea, Genesys or third parties could create paid modules that users could purchase to make it easier to complete his task in the Ghostbusters chat.

						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Yes, the ideas just flew back and forth between the team members.
							But back to our first idea of creating a bot that could also safely and easily get non-developers on board.
							Together with product management, we designed a bot-led conversation that allowed all important elements of the application to be presented.
							Of course we used the Ghostbusters story as a theme and as a special treat, De:Bot turned into a ghost during the conversation.

						In early July, we finally tested the prototype with seven internal users and members of the senior US sales team.
						In summary, points 'Good overall design and Information Architecture' and 'Good story behind the onboarding' stand out particularly positively.
						The entire onboarding process was a bit too long.
						There were suggestions here that you could ask the bot for a break in the conversation.

							Nobody would have thought that our bot creation application could have such a wonderful conversation with its users.

							We got the green light and the full support of all senior management.
						</p>
						<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
							Now that we were at the point that sales would support us to test with real users we didn't know how to proceed immediately.
							No design team has ever been at this point before at Genesys.
							My answer was organising a couple of ideation sessions with senior stakeholders with the goal to get lined up ten B2B users for testing within the next two months.

					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						The product team regularly sent a presentation with an overload of information to customers to get in touch.
						The response rate was quite low. But I was able to get everyone on board with the idea of a little product promotion video.
						The copy and animation for the promotion video was ready, but we were missing sound.
						To convince our PM I did the first voiceover. My German accent was probably not so well received and the product manager showed how it can be done so much better.
					</p>
					<p class="text-style-p text-color-grey-blue-200">
						Within two weeks we were able to double our expectations and lined up more than twenty customers who wanted to support us doing regular user testing on Dialog Engine.
